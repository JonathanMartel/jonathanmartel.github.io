2015 was a crazy year for me, a lot happened and much of it is down to this blog and you as a wonderful reader/sharer of my content. I've grown immensely professionally, in my writing capabilities, ability to articulate things in an easy-to-read fashion so you readers can learn in the best way I can attempt to teach you. I've also spoken at a lot more conferences, meetups, and my blog and feedback has really helped me learn new things, dive more in-depth into technology and provide a lot more business value to companies I worked and work for.

### Thank you

First of all, a huge thank you to anyone who's a read my blog once or is a regular reader. Thank you for sharing my content and leaving such fantastic feedback in post comment sections.

Feedback through comments really inspires me to improve myself and provide even better content to help you learn, as well as getting a great buzz on teaching whoever you are in the world something new!

I get a tonne of comments a week throughout various different articles, and there's a great buzz when I wake up and read a comment from someone across the globe thanking me for the article.

### Statistics (Google Analytics)

Secondly, I'd like to share some interesting stats from the growth of my blog over the last year, compared with last year's Google Analytics.

##### 2014:

{% highlight javascript %}
Visits: 977,674
Users: 673,164
Page Views: 1,674,190
{% endhighlight %}

##### 2015:

{% highlight javascript %}
Visits: 1,440,912
Users: 972,189
Page Views: 2,184,550
{% endhighlight %}

##### Growth:

{% highlight javascript %}
Visits: 463,238
Users: 299,025
Page Views: 510,360
{% endhighlight %}

`299,025` additional readers is an absolutely crazy amount of people in my eyes, with an additional half a million extra page views. I started this blog initially as a place to keep track of useful code that I use from time to time. Needless to say it's grown into a playground to teach myself new things, experiment, throw ideas around and teach others - and I love that.

### Data, devices, locations
