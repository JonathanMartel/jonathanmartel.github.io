AngularJS 1.6 [was just released](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#160-rainbow-tsunami-2016-12-08)! Here's the low down on what to expect for the [component method](/exploring-the-angular-1-5-component-method/) changes as well as `$http` Promise method deprecations and the amazing new `ngModelOptions` inheritance feature.

> The purpose of this article is to focus on the most important changes, `$onInit` and `ngModelOptions` inheritance.

The [official](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/migration) documentation guides you through some of the smaller nitty gritty stuff that likely won't affect you as much.

### Component and $onInit

Let's begin with the most important update and recommendation if you're using AngularJS 1.5 components and their [lifecycle hooks](/angular-1-5-lifecycle-hooks).

#### Initialisation logic

When we initialise a particular model on a component's controller instance, we'd typically do something like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
const mortgageForm = {
  template: `
    <form>
      {% raw %}{{ $ctrl.applicant | json }}{% endraw %}
    </form>
  `,
  controller() {
    this.applicant = {
      name: 'Todd Motto',
      email: 'todd@toddmotto.com'
    };
  }
};

angular.module('app').component('mortgageForm', mortgageForm);
{% endhighlight %}

> Note: here we are _not_ using `$onInit`, but can set an Object on a controller, pay attention to this next bit

However, when we switch this to using input `bindings` - which is likely the case in a real world application - 1.6 introduces a new change. Let's assume this:

{% highlight javascript %}
const mortgageForm = {
  bindings: {
    applicant: '<'
  },
  template: `
    <form>{% raw %}{{ $ctrl.applicant | json }}{% endraw %}</form>
  `,
  controller() {
    console.log(this.applicant);
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

The `template` will of course render out the Object passed into the binding, however - the `this.applicant` log inside the controller will _NOT_ be available. To "fix" this (it's not essentially a fix though), you'll need to use `$onInit`:

{% highlight javascript %}
const mortgageForm = {
  bindings: {
    applicant: '<'
  },
  template: `
    <form>{% raw %}{{ $ctrl.applicant | json }}{% endraw %}</form>
  `,
  controller() {
    this.$onInit = () => {
      console.log(this.applicant);
    };
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

Better yet, use an ES6 class or Typescript:

{% highlight javascript %}
const mortgageForm = {
  bindings: {
    applicant: '<'
  },
  template: `
    <form>{% raw %}{{ $ctrl.applicant | json }}{% endraw %}</form>
  `,
  controller: class MortgageComponent {
    constructor() {}
    $onInit() {
      console.log(this.applicant);
    }
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

Using `$onInit` guarantees that the `bindings` are assigned before using them.

>  The reasoning behind this change is that it is not idiomatic JavaScript to bind properties to an Object before its constructor has been called - which also prevents people from using native ES6 classes as controllers.

#### $onInit and ngOnInit

Let's look at an AngularJS 1.x and Angular v2+ comparison momentarily before we step back to 1.6 as this will add some reason behind this change.

Assume our AngularJS component using an ES6 class:

{% highlight javascript %}
const mortgageForm = {
  ...
  template: `<form>...</form>`
  controller: class MortgageComponent {
    constructor(MortgageService) {
      this.mortgageService = MortgageService;
    }
    $onInit() {
      this.mortgageService.doSomethingWithUser(this.applicant);
    }
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

In Angular, we'd do the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
@Component({
  selector: 'mortgage-form',
  template: `<form>...</form>`
})
class MortgageComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private mortgageService: MortgageService) {}
  ngOnInit() {
    this.mortgageService.doSomethingWithUser(this.applicant);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This approach treats the `constructor` function as the "wiring" of dependencies to be injected, be it AngularJS or Angular. If you're planning to upgrade your codebase, then adopting this strategy as early as possible is a huge win.

#### Re-enabling auto-bindings

If you're upgrading to 1.6 and can't change your entire codebase at once, you can drop in this configuration to enable the bindings _back_ so they work outside `$onInit`:

{% highlight javascript %}
.config(function($compileProvider) {
  $compileProvider.preAssignBindingsEnabled(true);
});
{% endhighlight %}

This should really be done as a temporary solution whilst you're switching things across to `$onInit`. Once you're done making necessary changes, remove the above configuration.

> Note: the configuration will be application-wide, so keep this in mind.

#### Recommendation

Always use `$onInit`, even if you're not accepting `bindings`. Never put anything, besides public methods on your `controller`.

A small example to demonstrate what will no longer work in 1.6, and _will_ require `$onInit`:

{% highlight javascript %}
const mortgageForm = {
  bindings: {
    applicant: '<'
  },
  template: `<form>...</form>`
  controller: function () {
    if (this.applicant) {
      // not accessible, needs $onInit
      this.applicant.name = 'Tom Delonge';
    }
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

> Remember: this change means _bindings_ inside the `constructor`, are undefined and now require `$onInit`

A fuller example _with_ bindings and public methods to illustrate (however the bindings could be omitted here and your properties must exist inside `$onInit`):

{% highlight javascript %}
const mortgageForm = {
  bindings: {
    applicant: '<'
  },
  template: `<form>...</form>`
  controller: class MortgageComponent {
    constructor(MortgageService) {
      this.mortgageService = MortgageService;
    }
    $onInit() {
      // initialisation state props
      this.submitted = false;
      this.resolvedApplicant = {};
      // service call
      this
        .mortgageService
        .getApplication(this.applicant)
        .then(response => {
          this.resolvedApplicant = response;
        });
    }
    updateApplication(event) {
      this.submitted = true;
      this.mortgageService.updateApplication(event);
    }
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

That brings us to the end of `$onInit` and the changes you need to consider when migrating and the reasons for doing so.

### $http success() and error()

The legacy `.success()` and `.error()` methods have finally been removed - please upgrade your applications to align with the new Promise API.

#### Refactoring to then()

You'll potentially have code that looks like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
function MortgageService() {
  function handleSuccess(data, status, headers, config) {
    // use data, status, headers, config
    return data;
  }

  function handleError(data, status, headers, config) {
    // handle errors
  }
  return {
    getApplication(applicant) {
      return $http
        .get(`/api/${applicant.id}`)
        .success(handleSuccess)
        .error(handleError);
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `Promise` would then be returned for a typical `then()` callback somewhere in your component's controller. The _success_ and _error_ methods are deprecated and have been removed.

You'll need this instead (note everything is contained in the `response` argument instead):

{% highlight javascript %}
function MortgageService() {
  function handleSuccess(response) {
    // use response
    // response: { data, status, statusText, headers, config }
    return response.data;
  }

  function handleError(response) {
    // handle errors
  }
  return {
    getApplication(applicant) {
      return $http
        .get(`/api/${applicant.id}`)
        .then(handleSuccess)
        .catch(handleError);
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Or some ES6 destructuring fun:

{% highlight javascript %}
function MortgageService() {
  // argument destructuring
  function handleSuccess({data}) {
    return data;
  }
  function handleError(response) {
    // assignment destructuring
    const { data, status } = response;
    // use data or status variables
  }
  ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's move onto the new `ngModelOptions` feature.

### ngModelOptions and inheritance

Using `ngModelOptions` allows you to specify how a particular model updates, any debounce on the model setters (which in turns forces a `$digest`) and what events you'd like to listen to.

An example:

{% highlight html %}
<input
  type="text"
  name="fullname"
  ng-model="$ctrl.applicant.name"
  ng-model-options="{
    'updateOn': 'default blur',
    'debounce': {
      'default': 200,
      'blur': 0
    }
  }">
{% endhighlight %}

This tells `ng-model` to update the models on the `default` events, such as `paste` and `input`. It also specifies a `debounce` to delay model setting. On the `default` event, this delay is set to `200` milliseconds - meaning you are not forcing a `$digest` every key stroke, but waiting until `200ms` after the user has finished the operation. This also ties nicely with backend API requests, as the model will not be set - therefore no request is made every keystroke to the API.

Similarly, the `blur` is set to `0`, meaning we want to ensure the models are changed as soon as a blur occurs, which works nicely with things like validation errors or hitting a backend API.

#### Repetition problem

Using `ngModelOptions` is the _best_ performance enhancement you can give your inputs, but when you have multiple `<input>` nodes, you end up with something like this:

{% highlight html %}
<input
  type="text"
  name="fullname"
  ng-model="$ctrl.applicant.name"
  ng-model-options="{
    'updateOn': 'default blur',
    'debounce': {
      'default': 200,
      'blur': 0
    }
  }">
<input
  type="email"
  name="email"
  ng-model="$ctrl.applicant.email"
  ng-model-options="{
    'updateOn': 'default blur',
    'debounce': {
      'default': 200,
      'blur': 0
    }
  }">
<input
  type="text"
  name="postcode"
  ng-model="$ctrl.applicant.postcode"
  ng-model-options="{
    'updateOn': 'default blur',
    'debounce': {
      'default': 200,
      'blur': 0
    }
  }">
{% endhighlight %}

At which point, it becomes messy very quickly.

#### Using inheritance

This is something I've been waiting for in 1.x for _too long_. Scoped inheritance for `ngModelOptions`!

Let's take a look at that first example and refactor it, as we're using the same options everywhere:

{% highlight html %}
<form ng-submit="$ctrl.onSubmit()" ng-model-options="{
  'updateOn': 'default blur',
  'debounce': { 'default': 200, 'blur': 0 }
}">
  <input
    type="text"
    name="fullname"
    ng-model="$ctrl.applicant.name">
  <input
    type="email"
    name="email"
    ng-model="$ctrl.applicant.email">
  <input
    type="text"
    name="postcode"
    ng-model="$ctrl.applicant.postcode">
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

> `ngModel` was always able to inherit from an ancestor `ngModelOptions`, however `ngModelOptions` can now also inherit from an ancestor `ngModelOptions`

Let's look at `ngModelOptions` inheriting from `ngModelOptions`.

#### Control level optional inheritance

We also have the ability to override specific options, whilst inheriting others using `$inherit`.

Let's assume our _entire_ form is going to use the same options, however what we want is to only update our `postcode` input on the `blur` event:

{% highlight html %}
<form ng-submit="$ctrl.onSubmit()" ng-model-options="{
  'allowInvalid': true,
  'updateOn': 'default blur',
  'debounce': { 'default': 200, 'blur': 0 }
}">
  <!-- omitted other inputs for brevity -->
  <input
    type="text"
    name="postcode"
    ng-model="$ctrl.applicant.postcode"
    ng-model-options="{
      '*': '$inherit',
      'updateOn': 'blur'
    }">
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

The above `'*'` uses the wildcard to tell `ngModelOptions` to inherit all options from the parent - so you don't have to keep repeating them but can fine-tune individual inputs. This is extremely powerful and productive.

We can also optionally choose to fallback to `ngModelOptions` default values (not the ones specified on the parent container) if we _omit_ the wildcard `$inherit`. For example:

{% highlight html %}
<form ng-submit="$ctrl.onSubmit()" ng-model-options="{
  'allowInvalid': true,
  'updateOn': 'default blur',
  'debounce': { 'default': 200, 'blur': 0 }
}">
  <!-- omitted other inputs for brevity -->
  <input
    type="text"
    name="postcode"
    ng-model="$ctrl.applicant.postcode"
    ng-model-options="{
      'updateOn': '$inherit'
    }">
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

This new `ngModelOptions` binding will in fact override the entire inheritance chain for that particular input - however it _does_ inherit the `updateOn` property.

You can obviously mix and match these for your specific use case, but these three examples give you global inheritance, omitted value inheritance and single property inheritance.

### Migration / changelog

Check the Angular [1.6 migration guide](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/migration#migrating-from-1-5-to-1-6) for some of the other noteworthy enhancements (such as the improve `input[type=range]` support) - for me these were the big ones to ensure you're writing your AngularJS applications with the most up-to-date practices.

Huge shout out to [Pete Bacon Darwin](https://twitter.com/petebd) - lead AngularJS developer - and other collaborators that have been working on this release for so long. Angular 1.x is very much alive and it's direction is being steered not only towards Angular practices, but better practices in general.
