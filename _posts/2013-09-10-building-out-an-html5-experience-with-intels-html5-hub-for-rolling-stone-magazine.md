Back in June this year, I was approached by Intel and Rolling Stone magazine to create the first online HTML5 experience for the new [HTML5 Hub](http://html5hub.com) project. HTML5 Hub is a platform for showcasing, talking, and building out original experiences on the web with HTML5. Backed by Intel, I was thrilled to have been invited as a Founding Contributor to the Hub.

Joining the HTML5 Hub meant a great deal to me, what an exciting adventure. It's amazing to see large corporations jumping in and taking grasp of future technologies, and I am honoured to be a part of it!

You can check out the article from the links below. Blood, sweat and tears have gone into making the HTML5 experience possible and I hope you enjoy reading and viewing it as much as I enjoyed coding it and working with the team to bring it to life. Thanks to all at the Hub, film crew and Rolling Stone for the support and incredible design!

Here's my documentary from the project and insight into my background, life and experience.
