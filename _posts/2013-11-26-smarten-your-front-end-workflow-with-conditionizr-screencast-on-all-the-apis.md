Who's using Conditionizr? So far we've found some teams at _Google_, _Sencha_, _NASA_ are some great names using it.

Conditionizr (.NET Magazine's Open Source Project of the Year finalist), is a standalone JavaScript tool that detects front-end environments and returns an Object with boolean values on given test states. You can use Conditionizr with various public APIs to make your cross platform/device/browser development much easier and manageable. These APIs include adding your own tests, dynamic polyfills (eradicating conditional comments), callbacks for specific environment tests.
